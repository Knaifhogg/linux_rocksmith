<details><summary>Know already what's going on? Here are all commands in one piece without an explanation</summary>

If the commands in this collapsible section don't work for you, try the "longer" variant first before asking for help.

YOU NEED TO HAVE THE $PROTON VARIABLE SET!! (or replaced with the correct path first)

cd into the unpacked directory, then run this.

```
rm -rf build32
rm -rf build64
sudo cp build32/wineasio.dll 000-x32windows-000/wineasio.dll
sudo cp build32/wineasio.dll.so 000-x32unix-000/wineasio.dll.so
sudo cp build64/wineasio.dll 000-x64windows-000/wineasio.dll
sudo cp build64/wineasio.dll.so 000-x64unix-000/wineasio.dll.so
cp build32/wineasio.dll "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-windows/wineasio.dll"
cp build32/wineasio.dll.so "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-unix/wineasio.dll.so"
cp build64/wineasio.dll "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-windows/wineasio.dll"
cp build64/wineasio.dll.so "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio.dll.so"
```

And you're done, continue with [Setting up the game's prefix/compatdata](#setting-up-the-games-prefixcompatdata).
