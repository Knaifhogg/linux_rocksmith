<details><summary>Know already what's going on? Here are all commands in one piece without an explanation</summary>

If the commands in this collapsible section don't work for you, try the "longer" variant first before asking for help.

YOU NEED TO HAVE THE $PROTON AND $STEAMLIBRARY VARIABLE SET!! (or replaced with the correct path first)

cd into the unpacked directory, then run this.

```
rm -rf build32
rm -rf build64
make 32
make 64
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll 000-x32windows-000/wineasio32.dll
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll.so 000-x32unix-000/wineasio32.dll.so
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll 000-x64windows-000/wineasio64.dll
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll.so 000-x64unix-000/wineasio64.dll.so
cp build32/wineasio32.dll "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-windows/wineasio32.dll"
cp build32/wineasio32.dll.so "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-unix/wineasio32.dll.so"
cp build64/wineasio64.dll "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-windows/wineasio64.dll"
cp build64/wineasio64.dll.so "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio64.dll.so"
env WINEPREFIX=$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680/pfx ./wineasio-register
```

And you're done, continue with [Installing RS_ASIO](#installing-rs_asio).
