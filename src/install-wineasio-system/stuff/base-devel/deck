Installing `base-devel` is very useful for using the AUR and compiling in general.

On SteamOS the following additional packages were required to compile wineasio:

```
sudo pacman -S base-devel glibc linux-headers linux-api-headers libtool binutils lib32-glibc
# note about these two packages: they are in conflict with lib32-pipewire-jack pipewire-jack
# pacman can remove these packages for you and we can reinstall them once wineasio is compiled
sudo pacman -S lib32-jack2 jack2
```
