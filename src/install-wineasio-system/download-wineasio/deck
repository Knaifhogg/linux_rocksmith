The official source for wineasio is [wineasio/wineasio](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio), however I could not get it to work with pipewire-jack.

I took the [fixed version from here](https://github.com/TobiasKozel/wineasio) and modified it slightly to get it to compile on the Steam Deck, see [here](https://github.com/BWagener/wineasio/commit/8e24a15801b5980c9245ebf4fe30a722857f7e40) for the modification I made.

```
# retrieve fixed version:
git clone https://github.com/BWagener/wineasio.git
cd wineasio
