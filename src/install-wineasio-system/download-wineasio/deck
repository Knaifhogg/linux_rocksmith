The official source for wineasio is [wineasio/wineasio](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio). If the official one doesn't work, clone the fixed version from here: https://github.com/BWagener/wineasio.git

[Download](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/releases) the newest zip and unpack it. Open a terminal inside the newly created folder and run the following commands:

(Release Packages are easier to replicate. Support for cloning steps only with BWagener's version.)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio.git
cd wineasio
```
