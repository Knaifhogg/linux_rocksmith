**This guide will use the Steam package from "RPM Fusion nonfree". This is to avoid sandboxing being complicated for now.**

An alternative way to do this via Flatpak is described [here](https://github.com/theNizo/linux_rocksmith/issues/31) Please note that the maintainer (theNizo) has no experience with Flatpak.

I assume that `pipewire` and a session manager (eg. `wireplumber`, or `pipewire-media-session`) is already installed.

If native JACK is installed already, please remove it by running `sudo dnf remove jack-*` before continuing.

```
sudo dnf install -y gcc make glibc-devel.i686 wine wine-devel.* pipewire-jack*.* pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulseaudio realtime-setup pavucontrol qpwgraph
