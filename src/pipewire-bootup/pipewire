# Small Troubleshooting: The game crashes

## Immediately

When I first tried to set the game up with pipewire, I experienced this.
The solution was the following:

1. Start game
1. As soon as you see the window, take the focus away from it. Focus a different window. Do that as quick as possible. When testing, I needed two tries.
1. If you run it from terminal, wait until logs start to appear.
1. Otherwise, wait a few seconds (10-20), or if you can see the window, wait until the bootup logos show up. Sometimes you will hear sound when unfocussed, sometimes not.
1. Focus the game again

## When messing with Patchbay

Rocksmith doesn't like the patchbay being tampered with very much. It might crash on you if you try something like this.

## When Focussing on the window again

Also, unfocussing and focussing again has the risk of the game crashing too. It won't always crash, but the possibility is high enough to notice.
