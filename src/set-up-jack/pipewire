I prefer to set up my audio devices with pavucontrol ("PulseAudio Volume Control"), which works if `pipewire-pulse` is installed.

It's most reliable to NOT set your devices to Pro-Audio (under "Configuration") and leave pavucontrol open when starting the game.

All available devices will automatically be tied to Rocksmith, and the game doesn't like you messing around in the patchbay (= it's possible, but would crash often). You default audio device will be taken first, then the others will be assigned. The order can most likely not be predicted.

If you want to make sure it does what you want, select only one output and just as much inputs as you need (1 input (eg. singleplayer) = 1 device; 2 inputs (eg. 2 Players) = 2 devices, etc.). I like to do this via `pavucontrol`, which works if `pipewire-pulse` is installed.
