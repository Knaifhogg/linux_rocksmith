Installing `base-devel` is very useful for using the AUR and compiling in general.

On SteamOS the following additional packages were required to compile wineasio:

```
# We temporarlily install jack2 so that we can compile wineasio. We'll reinstall pipewire-jack afterwards.
sudo pacman -S base-devel glibc linux-headers linux-api-headers libtool binutils lib32-glibc lib32-jack2 jack2
```
