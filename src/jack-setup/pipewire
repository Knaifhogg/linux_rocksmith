What we basically need to do is to select only one output and just as much inputs as you need (1 input (eg. singleplayer) = 1 device; 2 inputs (eg. 2 Players) = 2 devices, etc.). I like to do this via `pavucontrol`, which works if `pipewire-pulse` is installed.

Open pavucontrol ("PulseAudio Volume Control"), go to "Configuration" and make sure the amount of enabled input devices matches the amount of inputs you want for Rocksmith.

All available devices will automatically be tied to Rocksmith, and the game doesn't like you messing around in the patchbay (= it's possible, but would crash often).
