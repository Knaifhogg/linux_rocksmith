1. Open Cadence. If it says on the bottom left that you should log out and back in, and you already did that, restart your machine.
1. Go to `Configure -> Engine`. Make sure that "Realtime" is ticked.
1. Go to "Driver", select ALSA.
 * If you use the same device for input and output, untick "Duplex Mode" and select the device you want to use in the first line. If you use different devices for in- and output, tick "Duplex Mode" and select the devices in the 2nd and 3rd line. Please note that the names are not that intuitive to begin with.
 * Input Channels: <no. of players>; Output Channels: 2 (Stereo)
 * Sample Rate: 48000
 * Buffer Size and Buffer Periods: 256/4 (~5ms) works fine for me and others. Bigger Buffer Size equals more stability and higher latency. AFAIK you can reduce the Buffer Size, if you add more Periods, but I'm not sure about that.
1. Press okay and go to `Tweaks -> WineASIO
 * Tick everything
 * Match No. of in- and -outputs
 * Match Buffer size
1. Press apply
