Right click on the shortcut and select "Properties". Add these launch Options: `PIPEWIRE_LATENCY="256/48000" %command%`

`PIPEWIRE_LATENCY`: Rocksmith needs a sample rate of 48000. 256 refers to the buffer size. This number worked great for me and others, but you can experiment with different values, of course.
