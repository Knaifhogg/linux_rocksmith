# Differences of Proton versions 6.5 and below

As older Proton versions are used less, it does not make sense for me to create guides for those versions specifically. So I will list the difference between older Proton versions and recent ones.

## What do you actually have to do different?

Older Proton only used `wineasio.dll.so` and didn't have `wineasio.dll` (".so" being the difference between the two).
The location also differs slightly. Currently it is (example) `/usr/lib/wine/i386-unix/wineasio.dll.so`, whereas it was `/usr/lib/wine/wineasio.dll.so` before.

So the installation commands are as follows:
